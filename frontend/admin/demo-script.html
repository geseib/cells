                <div class="script-paragraph">
                    <p>"Each cell is a complete stack: Lambda functions for the API, a DynamoDB table for that cell's data, an S3 bucket for static content, and a CloudFront distribution. This isolation is critical - if one cell's database has issues, other cells continue operating normally."</p>

                    <p>"So what have we learned today? Cell-based architecture gives us several critical benefits:"</p>
                </div>
                <div class="script-paragraph">
                    <p>"First, fault isolation. When something goes wrong - and something always goes wrong - only a fraction of your customers are affected. Second, horizontal scalability. Need more capacity? Add more cells. It's that simple."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="script-paragraph">
                    <p>"Third, operational excellence. You can deploy to one cell at a time, monitor its health, and roll back if needed - all without affecting other cells. And finally, predictable performance. Each cell has a known capacity, making it much easier to capacity plan and maintain SLAs."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="script-paragraph">
                    <p>"This pattern has been battle-tested at massive scale. Netflix uses it for their streaming infrastructure. Amazon uses it for retail systems. When you need to build systems that can handle millions of users with high reliability, cell-based architecture is a proven solution."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="script-paragraph">
                    <p>"I hope this demonstration has given you insights into how cell-based architecture works and why it's so powerful. Are there any questions about what we've covered today?"</p>
